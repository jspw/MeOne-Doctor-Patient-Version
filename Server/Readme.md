## Medone Server

### Start Server

At first you have to create a `.env` file, and add your `MONGO_URI` in it. Have a look at the `.env.example` for more information.

Then run `npm i` to install the required packages. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server (Nodemon is required). Or run `npm start` to start the production server.
